# Python Learning Journal - Day 7  
**Voice-Controlled Automation with While Loops**  

## 🎤 Core Concepts Covered

### 1. Speech Recognition Setup
```python
# Install required libraries
pip install SpeechRecognition PyAudio

# Basic speech recognition
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Speak now (10 second limit):")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=10)
    print("Processing...")
    
command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
print("You said:", command)
```

### 2. While Loop Fundamentals
```python
# Basic while loop structure
while condition:
    # Code to repeat
    if exit_condition:
        break
```

### 3. Voice-Controlled Automation
```python
import os
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

while True:
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("\nOptions: Open notepad | Launch Chrome | Send WhatsApp | Say 'stop' to exit")
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=10)
        
    try:
        command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
        print("You said:", command)
        
        if "stop" in command:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        elif "notepad" in command and "don't" not in command:
            os.system("notepad")
        elif "chrome" in command:
            os.system("start chrome")
        elif "whatsapp" in command:
            print("WhatsApp functionality would execute here")
        else:
            print("Command not recognized")
            
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I didn't catch that")
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Speech service unavailable")
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### While Loop Behavior
| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `while True:` | Infinite loop (requires `break`) |
| `while condition:` | Runs until condition is False |
| `break` | Immediately exits loop |
| `continue` | Skips to next iteration |

### Speech Recognition Flow
1. Microphone captures audio
2. Google's API converts speech to text
3. Text is processed for commands
4. System executes matching action

## 🛠️ Project: Voice Assistant

```python
import os
import speech_recognition as sr
import pywhatkit  # For WhatsApp functionality

def voice_assistant():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    
    while True:
        try:
            with sr.Microphone() as source:
                print("\n🔊 Say a command (notepad/chrome/whatsapp/stop):")
                audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=5)
                
            command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
            print("You said:", command)
            
            if "stop" in command:
                print("Shutting down...")
                break
            elif "notepad" in command:
                os.system("notepad")
                print("Notepad opened!")
            elif "chrome" in command:
                os.system("start chrome")
                print("Chrome launched!")
            elif "whatsapp" in command:
                pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg("+1234567890", "Automated message", 15, 30)
                print("WhatsApp message scheduled!")
            else:
                print("Try saying 'notepad', 'chrome', or 'whatsapp'")
                
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            print("Sorry, I didn't understand that")
        except sr.RequestError:
            print("Having trouble accessing the speech service")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    voice_assistant()
```

## 📌 Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always wrap speech recognition in try-except blocks
2. **Timeout**: Set reasonable timeout limits for user input
3. **Feedback**: Provide visual/audio feedback for each action
4. **Case Insensitivity**: Convert commands to lowercase for consistency
5. **Exit Condition**: Always provide a clear way to exit infinite loops

## 🚀 Next Steps

- [ ] Add more voice commands (calculator, email, etc.)
- [ ] Implement text-to-speech responses
- [ ] Create a GUI interface
- [ ] Add error logging
- [ ] Package as executable application
