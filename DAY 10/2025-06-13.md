# Python Learning Journal - Day 10  
**Generators & Memory-Efficient Iteration**  

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

### 1. Generators vs Regular Functions
| Feature            | Regular Function      | Generator Function      |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Keyword**        | `return`              | `yield`                 |
| **Memory Usage**   | High (all at once)    | Low (one at a time)     |
| **State**          | Lost after return     | Preserved between calls |
| **Usage**          | `result = func()`     | `iterator = gen_func()` |

### 2. Generator Basics
```python
# Simple generator example
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1

# Usage
counter = count_up_to(5)
print(next(counter))  # 1
print(next(counter))  # 2
```

### 3. Memory Comparison
```python
# Memory-inefficient approach
def get_squares(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i*i)
    return result  # Stores ALL squares in memory

# Memory-efficient generator
def generate_squares(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i*i  # Yields one at a time
```

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

### 1. Processing Large Datasets
```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    """Yield one line at a time from huge file"""
    with open(file_path) as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

# Process 10GB file without loading it entirely
for line in read_large_file("huge_data.txt"):
    process(line)  # Memory stays constant
```

### 2. Infinite Sequence
```python
def fibonacci():
    """Infinite Fibonacci sequence generator"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Usage
fib = fibonacci()
print(next(fib))  # 0
print(next(fib))  # 1
print(next(fib))  # 1
```

### 3. `yield from` Delegation
```python
def combined_generator():
    yield from range(5)
    yield from ['a', 'b', 'c']
    yield from (x*x for x in range(3))

# Yields: 0,1,2,3,4,a,b,c,0,1,4
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why Use Generators?
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Process TBs of data with KBs of RAM
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Compute only what's needed
3. **Pipeline Processing**: Chain generators for complex workflows
4. **Infinite Sequences**: Represent endless streams

### Performance Characteristics
| Operation          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| List Creation      | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| Generator Creation | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Next Item          | O(1)            | O(1)             |

## 📚 Advanced Topics

### 1. Generator Expressions
```python
# Similar to list comprehension but lazy
squares_gen = (x*x for x in range(1000000))  # No memory allocated
```

### 2. Sending Values to Generators
```python
def accumulator():
    total = 0
    while True:
        value = yield total
        if value is None: break
        total += value

acc = accumulator()
next(acc)  # Start generator
print(acc.send(10))  # 10
print(acc.send(20))  # 30
```

### 3. Generator-Based Pipelines
```python
def filter_odd(numbers):
    for n in numbers:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            yield n

def square(numbers):
    for n in numbers:
        yield n ** 2

# Chained processing
numbers = range(1000000)
pipeline = square(filter_odd(numbers))
```
